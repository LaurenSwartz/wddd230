            Whitespace is a term used to describe the negative spacing between elements in a design. It can be used to group elements together or separate them to give them greater importance. The spacing in the website is sufficient enough for all content to fit providing nice spatial balance to the overall design.

        <p>Harnessing typefaces can give your website its own personality and call attention to certain areas. 
           Typefaces with different sizes and weights can also be used to increase hierarchy and make more important
           text elements stand out. 
           
           The takealot website uses headings to give content an order of importance.

                Alignment simply refers to how elements are placed on a page. Its purpose goes beyond organization, it is vital for enhancing the overall visual appeal of a design or page layout.
                The Alignment of the website is clear and content well positioned according to the layout of the page.
