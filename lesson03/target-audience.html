    <h2>Persona 1</h2>
	<p>
		John is 34 years old and was working for a global company and did not have much leisure time as his work was taking too much time. 
		So, to start a family, he decided to quit his job and invest his savings in a bookshop, which has been his dream since his university years. 
		All he wants to do is be able to maintain his bookshop.

		John needs a product that will handle the analysis of his income. He is looking for an easy-to-use product that enables him to see how many books he has sold,
		how much money he has made, how much money he has spent, which category and title is the best seller of his shop. 
		In addition, this product must give precise results and shorten the time he spends on managing the shop.

	<h2>Persona 2</h2>
	<p>
		Catelyn is 29 years old and is the customer success manager of a software company that provides customers with investing and trading tools. But their customers have a hard time understanding their tools, which affects their business. 
		As this problem is Catelyn’s concern due to her position, her boss requests an immediate solution to it. Catelyn is ready to prepare an onboarding process that will help its customers understand the use of the tool.

		Catelyn needs to be able to design this customer onboarding process by herself, as she designed. Instead of working with the company’s developers and designers, she needs to find a 3rd party company that will provide Catelyn with easy-to-use user onboarding software. 
		In that tool provided, she must not be expected to know how to code or create the designs for the customer onboarding flow.
