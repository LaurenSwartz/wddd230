                <p>Located in suburban Roodepoort, south of the railway line, Florida Lake boasts a bird sanctuary where a lake is home to a host of waterfowl that makes bird watching here a delight. 
                    The park also has a putt-putt course, an Olympic-sized swimming pool (that recently underwent repairs) and an adventure park for children. On public holidays the place is usually buzzing.</p>

                <p>Adults as well as children can learn to canoe at Florida Lake. Children can participate in regular races hosted at various clubs throughout Gauteng and earn points for completion of races which accumulate towards the annual prizegiving - the points are awarded to the paddler, the school they attend and the club where they train.</p>

                <p>It is a 128 hectare reserve within easy reach of the centre of Johannesburg and consists of pristine Highveld vegetation with craggy quartzite outcrops. There is a bird hide at the small dam on the reserve and a while spent here can be well worthwhile. The wildlife on the reserve is restricted to smaller creatures but it is surprisingly varied. 
                    Many Highveld tree species have their home in the reserve. The reserve also is home to the first mine on the Witwatersrand, which is a national heritage site. This enclosed area can only be visited by special arrangement.
